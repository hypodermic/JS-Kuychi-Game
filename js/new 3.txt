at the start they show you the words between 5 and 10 with the translations
when the game starts the words are scattered throughtout the level mixed in with other words, enemies, and pit falls
when you collect all the correct words you can go through to next level
but if you collect a wrong word level resets



let frameNum = function () {
let rando = Math.Random()*10
if (deco.frame > ) {}

}
